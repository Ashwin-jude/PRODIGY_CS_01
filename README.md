# Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation 🔐

A simple Python project that demonstrates how the **Caesar Cipher** works.  
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in a message is shifted a certain number of places in the alphabet.  

This project is aimed at helping beginners understand the basics of cryptography and how encryption and decryption can be implemented in Python.

## 🔧 Features
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom shift key.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters for flexibility.
- Non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, punctuation) remain unchanged.
- User-friendly prompts to guide you through encryption and decryption.
- Clear, commented Python code for learning purposes.
- Minimal setup required — runs on any Python 3 environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar_cipher.git
cd caesar_cipher


### 2. Run the script

bash
python caesar_cipher.py


### 3. Follow the prompts

* Enter a message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
* Enter a shift key (an integer value).
  Example: `3` will shift letters by 3 positions.
* Choose whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt**.

### 4. View the output

The script will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

## 💡 How the Cipher Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter of the message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a **Shift = 3**:

* A → D
* B → E
* C → F
* …
* X → A
* Y → B
* Z → C

To decrypt, the same shift is applied in reverse.
If the shift is `+3` for encryption, then `-3` is used for decryption.

## 🔍 Example

**Message:**

text
HELLO WORLD


**Shift:**

text
5


**Encrypted:**

text
MJQQT BTWQI


**Decrypted:**

text
HELLO WORLD
```

This demonstrates how the same shift key can be used to encode and decode a message.
